# Phase One (Weeks 1–2)
## System Re-Activation

### 🎯 Goal

Sharpen visual judgment using **inspectable, real-world products**.

This phase focuses on:
- Detecting structure quickly
- Recognizing consistency vs chaos
- Training visual restraint
- Developing judgment, not taste-by-vibes

---

## 🔁 Daily Practice (10–15 mins)

Pick **one** real website per day:

- Stripe
- Vercel
- Linear
- Notion
- Shopify
- Intercom
- Framer

Do **not** browse inspiration galleries.  
Use DevTools and visual inspection only.

---

### 1️⃣ CSS Overview Audit

Using Chrome DevTools → **CSS Overview**:

- Count font sizes
- Count colors
- Look for one-off random values

Write down:
- **Fonts:** X  
- **Colors:** X  

---

### 2️⃣ Extract Structural Signals (No Judgment)

Identify:

- Typography scale (example: `16 / 20 / 32 / 48`)
- Spacing scale (example: `8 / 16 / 24 / 32 / 64`)
- Primary content width (if applicable)

Do not evaluate yet.  
Just extract patterns.

---

### 3️⃣ Interpretation (Judgment Layer)

Answer **only** the following:

- **Control level**  
  Does the UI feel controlled or chaotic based on scale consistency?

- **Priority signal**  
  What element dominates attention first, and why?  
  (Size, contrast, position)

- **Restraint**  
  Where is restraint visible?  
  (Limited colors, minimal shadows, consistent radius)

- **One principle to steal**  
  Write one actionable rule you could apply elsewhere.

Keep this short. One or two lines per answer.

---

## 📅 Weekly Build Tasks (1–2 hrs)

Each week, choose **one pattern** you observed during daily practice:

- Pricing table
- Navigation bar
- Dashboard list
- Hero section

Rebuild it **in isolation**.

### Rules
- Define spacing scale first
- Define typography scale first
- No random values
- No decorative styling

Focus on structure, not polish.
