# Monthly Exercises
## Reverse-Engineering Practice

These exercises reinforce everything learned in the previous phases.

They are not about aesthetics or redesign.
They are about extracting **visual systems**, understanding **constraints**, and developing **visual judgment** through deliberate practice.

Complete **one exercise per month**.

---

## 🎯 Goal

Develop the ability to:

- Deconstruct mature interfaces into visual systems
- Identify intentional constraints and limits
- Apply extracted rules to your own work
- Improve visual judgment through critique and reflection

This is where visual culture becomes durable.

---

## ⏱ Time Commitment

- Total: 2–3 hours per month
- Can be split across multiple sessions

This exercise is intentionally lightweight but deep.

---

## 🧩 Exercise: Reverse-Engineer a Product

Pick **one mature product** (marketing site or app):

- Stripe
- Linear
- Shopify
- Vercel
- Notion
- Intercom

Avoid:
- Design showcases
- Templates
- Experimental or promotional sites

Prefer real, production interfaces that are actively used.

---

## Step 1 → System Extraction (30–45 mins)

Document **only** the following:

- Spacing scale (actual values observed)
- Typography scale (roles, not just sizes)
- Max content width(s)
- Border radius rules
- Elevation or shadow usage (if any)

Ignore:
- Illustrations
- Brand graphics
- Copywriting
- Marketing messaging

Focus on structure and rules, not styling.

---

## Step 2 → Constraint Summary (15 mins)

Write a short list answering:

- Which values are reused the most?
- Which values are intentionally missing?
- What feels deliberately limited?
- What would break if randomness was introduced?

Limit this to **5–7 bullet points**.

This step is critical — it turns observation into understanding.

---

## Step 3 → Minimal Rebuild (45–60 mins)

Rebuild **one** of the following:

- A single page layout  
**or**
- One core section (hero, pricing table, dashboard list)

### Rules

- Use only the extracted scales
- Introduce no new values
- Avoid decorative styling
- Focus on hierarchy, spacing, and clarity

This is not a pixel-perfect clone.  
It is a **system-faithful reconstruction**.

---

## 📦 Deliverable & Review

At the end of each exercise, you should have:

- A short system summary (tokens and rules)
- One rebuilt layout or section
- A small list of extracted principles

These artifacts are meant to be **shared for critique**, not kept private.

---

## 👀 Review Expectations

The purpose of sharing these artifacts is to receive **visual critique**, not validation.

### Primary Reviewers

- Designers are the **ideal reviewers** for these exercises.
- Their feedback helps surface issues in:
  - hierarchy
  - spacing
  - restraint
  - visual clarity

This external perspective is essential for developing visual maturity.

### Secondary Reviewers (Optional)

- Developers may also review artifacts once they have progressed through:
  - Phase One
  - Phase Two

At that stage, developers should be capable of giving **structure-based feedback**, not personal taste.

---

## 🧠 What to Ask Reviewers

When sharing an artifact, ask reviewers to focus on:

- Is hierarchy immediately clear?
- Does spacing feel calm and consistent?
- Is there unnecessary visual noise?
- What feels over-specified or under-specified?
- One concrete suggestion for simplification

Avoid asking:
- “Do you like it?”
- “Is this pretty?”

---

## 🔁 Reflection (10 mins)

After receiving feedback, answer briefly:

- Which rule felt most restrictive?
- Which rule improved clarity the most?
- Which rule would you adopt in future work?

Reflection is part of the exercise.  
Do not skip it.

---

## 🧠 Final Note

Visual culture is not built through inspiration.
It is built through **constraint, critique, and repetition**.

These exercises exist to support that process.
